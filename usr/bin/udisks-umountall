# this script is a replacement for udisks-umountall posted by Steffen Barzus
# ( https://bugs.launchpad.net/udisks-automounter/+bug/660020/comments/2 )
# the dbus interface for UDisks (the version in Ubuntu precise is quite old) is
# described at http://udisks.freedesktop.org/docs/1.0.5/ref-dbus.html
#
# It's single purpose is to list the /dev/* path for all external devices
# mounted by udisks so
# https://github.com/yavdr/yavdr-base/blob/master/usr/bin/vdr-mounter#L30 can
# umount them.
